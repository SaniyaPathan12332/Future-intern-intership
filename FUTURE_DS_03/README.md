# Event Feedback Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback collected from college events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities. The goal is to understand attendee satisfaction, identify areas of improvement, and provide actionable insights for event organizers.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations  
- NLP for sentiment analysis  

## Dataset  
- **File:** event_feedback.csv

  **Columns:**  
  - `Event_Name` – Name of the event  
  - `Participant_ID` – Unique identifier for each respondent  
  - `Rating` – Feedback rating (1–5)  
  - `Comments` – Open text feedback  

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates  
   - Standardized column names  
2. **Data Analysis**
   - Aggregated ratings by event type  
   - Performed sentiment analysis on text feedback  
3. **Visualization**
   - Plotted rating distributions, word clouds, and sentiment trends  
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identified most and least liked events  
   - Highlighted common issues reported by participants  
   - Provided actionable suggestions for improvement  

## Key Insights
- 🎯 Most popular events: `[Insert top events]`  
- ⚠️ Common complaints: `[Insert common issues]`  
- 😊 Overall sentiment: `[Positive / Neutral / Negative percentage]`  

## Recommendations
- Organize more of `[Top event type]` as students enjoyed them the most  
- Address `[common issues]` to improve overall satisfaction  
- Encourage participants to give detailed feedback for better insights
